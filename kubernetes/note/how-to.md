It looks like you want to create a Kubernetes Pod with both Nginx and Tomcat containers. Based on your YAML, you have both containers specified correctly, but here's the properly formatted version with proper indentation and an added comment for clarity:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-tomcat
  namespace: expense
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    - name: tomcat
      image: tomcat:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Explanation:
- **Pod Name**: The pod is named `nginx-tomcat` (you can change this to any name you prefer).
- **Namespace**: The pod is created in the `expense` namespace.
- **Containers**:
    - The `nginx` container runs the `nginx:latest` image and exposes port 80.
    - The `tomcat` container runs the `tomcat:latest` image and exposes port 8080.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Save this YAML configuration to a file, for example, `nginx-tomcat-pod.yaml`.
2. Apply the configuration using `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-tomcat-pod.yaml
   ```

3. Verify the Pod is created:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n expense
   ```

4. Once the pod is running, you can use `kubectl port-forward` to access either container on your local machine.

    - **For Nginx**:

      ```bash
      kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-tomcat 8080:80 -n expense
      ```

    - **For Tomcat**:

      ```bash
      kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-tomcat 8081:8080 -n expense
      ```

After running these commands, you can access Nginx via `http://localhost:8080` and Tomcat via `http://localhost:8081`.
